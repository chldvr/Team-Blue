[De Vera, Leoncio, Lucmayon]
Voice Identification using Pitch pattern recognition through Digital Signal Processing. 
This project will revolve around a voice recognition system that is trained to recognize specific speech by comparing amplitudes set in the database by the user. Using a recorded voice of one member of the group as the trained variable. For multi-variable testing, the other members of the group will be creating a similar audio file to test the efficiency of the program in terms of the trained variable that is stored. Wherein the program will attempt to compare all the recordings to the trained variable via the amplitude and pitch of the audio signal. The program must be able to match the trained variable to the audio recording with the same voice.
